## Purpose

This library is used to create and calculate trusses in the [Industry
Foundation Classes
(IFC)](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/)
standard. More precisely, the IFC 4.3 version is supported. This version
is an [ISO
standard](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-4-3-approved-as-a-final-standard/).

The following main functions are provided for building, viewing and
solving a truss model in IFC:

    ifctruss.build
    ifctruss.view
    ifctruss.solve

There are also a few additional side functions that can be used:

    ifctruss.save_ods_template
    ifctruss.save_xlsx_template
    ifctruss.build_from_ods
    ifctruss.build_from_xlsx
    ifctruss.save_result

Two solvers are available for calculating the trusses. These solvers can
also be used below without IFC:

    ifctruss.solver.direct_stiffness_method
    ifctruss.solver.calfem

learn more about using this library.
